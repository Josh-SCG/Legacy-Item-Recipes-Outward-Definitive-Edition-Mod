## What it does
Adds several recipies to the game that allow for the legacy items to become craftable by the player. This then does bypass the legacy chest system in place however does not interfere with it. The recipies are planned to make some semblance of sence. Eg. The savage weapons add occult remains to the fang weapons to more or so align with the description of "made from the bones of ancient beasts".

Currently, not all reciepies hold up to that standard of thinking (such as many of the armour or weapon upgrades simply taking palladium scrap).

## Future Versions
- Have the recipes make more logical sense within the world and lore of Outward (obviously ignoring the "passed down from your ancestor bit")
- Fix any recipes not working properly
- ???
- Profit
